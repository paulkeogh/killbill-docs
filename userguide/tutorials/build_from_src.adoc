= Build from src

This document describes how the kill bill artefacts can be build from their src distributions.

Note that there is an outstanding issue (https://github.com/killbill/killbill-oss-parent/issues/27)
which requires a change to the killbill-oss-parent project.

== Steps

* Check out the killbill-oss-client from either the kill bill git repository (https://github.com/killbill/killbill-oss-parent)

* Navigate to the local directory and edit the pom.xml file by updating the metrics-palominolabs.version
property from 3.2.1 to 3.2.2

* Run mvn install
